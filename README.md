This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node) project that allows users to log in and input information to calculate their BMR.
It integrates third party APIs and libraries such as Fetch and Axious for the user to track their daily food and exercises. The APIs return important information about the user's searched food/exercise such as calories consumed and burned, fat, carbs, and protein.
User BMR and food and exercise diary information are stored in MongoDB using Mongoose.
Users can view their previously saved food and exercises on different days using a React MUI calendar.
A npm package (chart.js) is used to develop pie charts and line graphs for the users to visualize and monitor daily calorie consumption and burned for the past month.
